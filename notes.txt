first init

Firstly, we are going to learn how to load in different files. Like csv and excel files.

LOADING DATA

1. First we import pandas as pd
2. Have a variable that reads the data. Like this:

data_csv = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')

If we print(data_csv), it'll print out all the data.

3. We can also load in .txt files. 

data_txt = pd.read_txt('textfile', header = 0, sep = ',')

The first argument is the file, second arg is the line where the file starts such that we don't
include that header in the data (but we include it in the column headers), and sep is the symbol 
that separates the rows inside the .txt file.

4. We can load excel files too.

data_excel = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')

First arg is the excel filename, second arg is the page within the file you want to read in.

5. We can load json files too.

data_json = pd.read_json('file.json')

Explanatory.

6. We can load in data from SQL databases.

- Import the library: import sqlite3
- Connect to the db: connection_db = sqlite3.connect("database_name.db")
- Now we can specify a query. Like this:

query_1 = 'SELECT col_1 FROM table_name'
